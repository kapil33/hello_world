    /*
    * Problem Statement: A nephew found out that his uncle loves him so much, that he would do anything to
    * buy him as many gifts as he possibly can. For this reason, the nephew prepares a list of gifts
    * that he wants and gives it to his uncle.
    * Each item in the list contains 2 integers: the day on which he wants the gift (today is day 0),
    * and the cost of it. The uncle, knowing that his nephew is preparing such a list,
    * saves $1 per day for the gifts, and initially (on day 0) he has $0.
    *
    * Calculate the maximum number of gifts the uncle can buy to his nephew.
    *
    * Input: The first line contains a single integer N â€” the number of gifts. Then N lines follow.
    * Each line contains two integers separated by space:
    *       d_i (the day that present i should be bought) and c_i (the cost of gift i).
    * Output: A single integer which is the maximum number of gifts the uncle can buy.
