# World of Algorithms!
This repo is dedicated to learn and practice algorithms.
This repo is divided in following sections:
1. /java/algorithms: it has questions grouped under different algorithms e.g. DP, Kadanes, Sorting etc.
2. /java/interviews: it has questions that were asked in different company interviews e.g. /java/interviews/2024/adyen/CheapestBankRoute
3. /java/javaoutputquestions: it has questions related to java language
4. /java/leetcode: it has questions picked up from Leetcode
5. /java/gfg: it has questions picked up from Geeks for Geeks

Now lets talk about some specific Data Structures:

# Graphs
Important Graph algorithms:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm:
  - It is a Single-Source-Shortest-Path algorithm, which means that it calculates shortest distance from one vertex to all the other vertices. 
  - Does not work for negative edge weights. 
  - Good read: https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1059477/A-noob's-guide-to-Djikstra's-Algorithm
  - Questions: https://leetcode.com/problem-list/mf5wgvxr/
- Union Find:
  - This algo is used whenever you see any kind of grouping in the elements 
  - It can only be applied to undirected graphs 
  - Good read: https://yuminlee2.medium.com/union-find-algorithm-ffa9cd7d2dba
  - Questions: https://leetcode.com/problem-list/mjqrceu6/
- Topological Sort:
  - It can only be applied on directed graphs and where there is some precedence of some tasks. For ex: T1->T2, task T1 should occur before task T2. 
  - Good read: https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1078072/introduction-to-topological-sort
  - Questions: https://leetcode.com/problem-list/mfu82mp1/
- Minimum Spanning Tree(MST):
  - Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm 
  - Good read: https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1131969/Minimum-Spanning-Tree-beginner's-guide
  - Questions:
    - https://leetcode.com/problem-list/ahtyr1q2/
    - https://leetcode.com/tag/minimum-spanning-tree/

# Strategy for Atlassian
DSA Round: do some research first 
1. Prep top 30-40 question of DSA from https://www.hellointerview.com/
2. Prep all the questions saved from your Leetcode account
3. Prep all the questions from HelloWorld project in IntelliJ

Code Design Round: do some research first
1. Write complete logic for snake game
2. Practice and revise from Flipkart's machine coding round.
3.
