# World of Algorithms!
This repo is dedicated to learn and practice algorithms.
This repo is divided in following sections:
1. /java/algorithms: it has questions grouped under different algorithms e.g. DP, Kadanes, Sorting etc.
2. /java/interviews: it has questions that were asked in different company interviews e.g. /java/interviews/2024/adyen/CheapestBankRoute
3. /java/javaoutputquestions: it has questions related to java language
4. /java/leetcode: it has questions picked up from Leetcode
5. /java/gfg: it has questions picked up from Geeks for Geeks

Now lets talk about some specific Data Structures:

# Graphs

Important Graph algorithms:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm: 
   2. It is a Single-Source-Shortest-Path algorithm, which means that it calculates shortest distance from one vertex to all the other vertices. 
   3. Does not work for negative edge weights.

   5. Questions: https://leetcode.com/problem-list/mf5wgvxr/
2. Union Find: 
   3. This algo is used whenever you see any kind of grouping in the elements
   4. It can only be applied to undirected graphs

   6. Questions: https://leetcode.com/problem-list/mjqrceu6/
3. Topological Sort: 
   4. It can only be applied on directed graphs and where there is some precedence of some tasks. For ex: T1->T2, task T1 should occur before task T2.
